Backstory: TeaLatte Bar is a local bubble tea spot that I visit a few times a week for light and refreshing drinks during study sessions. They recently opened for business a couple of months ago and I love all of their drinks. TeaLatte Bar has a huge emphasis on their drinks being made fresh from steeping tea leaves, no powder additives, and healthy sweetener substitutes. They also offer 2 different tea samples everyday, high speed internet, and excellent service to my community. I would like to make an attempt to make a website for them, and I am not affiliated with TeaLatte Bar.
